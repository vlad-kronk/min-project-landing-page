                                After playing the bass guitar in a band for years, the 21-year-old ellis moved
                                into electronic music back in 2016 for the purpose of creating and writing his 
                                own music and songs. The London-based producer and musician learned how to play
                                the decks next to his bass guitar. Ellis quickly made a name for himself within
                                the wider electronic house scene. The young producer is working hard to share his
                                music across the global electronic scene putting forth one strong production after
                                another characterized by catchy toplines, engaging basslines and funky drops.

                            Grant
                        </a></h2>

                                The evolution of grant has stemmed from a shift in artistic and personal
                                characteristics. It's a coming of age story that's told through music, art, and an
                                approachable personality. Being able to identify as yourself and not hide behind
                                the facade that a brand can sometimes hold, allows Grant to truly embrace himself
                                as an inspiration. Now Grant stands at the precipice of another level of expression.
                                This is music tied to a life lived with introspection and compassion. For those
                                looking to find inspiration, these songs are for you.
